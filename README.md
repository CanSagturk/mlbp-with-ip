# Solving MLBP and MLBPPO with IP

This is the repository of the framework that was used to run the experiments for the paper "An Integer Programming Approach to the Multi-Level
Bin Packing Problem with Partial Orders", by Can Sağtürk and Matthias G. Horn.

Here you can find:

- The experiment framework
- Mathematical models in C++
- All problem instances in the "inst" file
- The results of our experiments in the "results" file
